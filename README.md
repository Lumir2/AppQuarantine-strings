How do I contribute?
====================

App Quarantine is an app for users with root access. If you do not have root then you can not use all functions of the app. You still can help with translations even if you do not have root (and therefore can not verify all texts on your phone) but I would prefer that potential translators are able to install and test the app with updated translations. In this case please get in touch with me so I can send you updated APKs with your translations. As a benefit you will receive a key that unlocks ALL THE PRO FEATURES! ;)
